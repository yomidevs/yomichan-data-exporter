#+title: Yomichan Data Exporter

* Background

[[https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan][Yomichan]] is a very cool pop-up dictionary for web browsers. However, it has
been sunset.

[[https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/][Yomitan]] is a fork of Yomichan by [[https://github.com/yomidevs][Yomidevs]] which is actively maintained.

Migration from Yomichan to Yomitan is going to require people to be able to
move their dictionaries (of which there could be numerous) from Yomichan into
Yomitan. Yomichan lacks export support for dictionaries so people would have to
track down the individual dictionaries they imported and re-import them. This
has in fact been a sore point without concerning Yomitan as Yomichan has always
missed the migration story for when people want to move between devices or
browsers because dictionaries had to be imported one at a time every time.

Yomitan supports exporting and importing the
entire collection of dictionaries. However, the existing Yomichan extension installations don't have
the code that lets you export the database. Which means that we have no choice
but to inject and run the code on top of the extension somehow. This repository
is just to provide a method that works without much headache for the end-user
to that end.

* Steps to export the data

** On Firefox
+ Open Yomichan's setting page (click the gear icon from Yomichan's popup)
+ Open the web developer onsole
  - Hit =F12= or =CTRL + SHIFT + I= on Windows and Linux; =CMD + OPT + I= on MacOS
+ Switch to the =console= tab
+ Paste the following into the console and wait for the export + download to
  finish:
#+begin_src js
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yomidevs/yomichan-data-exporter/releases/latest/yomichan-data-exporter.min.js")
  .then((resp) => resp.text())
  .then((srcText) => {
    eval(srcText);
  })
  .then(async () => await exportDatabase())
  .catch((e) => console.error(e));
#+end_src
+ If you run into errors for the above somehow, try the same steps as Chrome below.

** On Chrome
+ Open Yomichan's setting page (click the gear icon from Yomichan's popup)
+ Open the web developer onsole
  - Hit =F12= or =CTRL + SHIFT + I= on Windows and Linux; =CMD + OPT + I= on MacOS
+ Switch to the =console= tab
+ Unfortunately(?!), Yomichan released on Chrome doesn't have permission to
  actually inject code (I tried a whole bunch of different approaches and the
  permissions are just lacking) so you are going to have to paste the contents
  of the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yomidevs/yomichan-data-exporter/releases/latest/yomichan-data-exporter.min.js][exporter code]] into the console.

  It is a very long "one-liner" and apparently github is pretty bad at handling
  all of it being put into a code box so you may want to open the raw file,
  select all, then copy and paste into the console. [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yomidevs/yomichan-data-exporter/releases/latest/yomichan-data-exporter.min.js][Link to the raw]].

+ Finally, paste the following into the console and wait for the export +
  download to finish:
#+begin_src js
await exportDatabase();
#+end_src

* Steps to import the exported Yomichan dictionaries data

You can actually import the exported dictionaries into existing installations
of Yomichan, but it is going to require similarly annoying console one-offs.

Instead, I strongly recommend migrating to [[https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/][Yomitan]] where there is first-class support for importing (and
exporting) this data in the =Backup= section of the settings page. The UI there
should be self-explanatory, but refer to the [[https://yomitan.wiki/other/yomichan-migration/][Yomitan documentation page]]
and Yomitan's welcome page for more information.
